# AQI Prediction, Forecasting, and Live Monitoring

## Overview
This project focuses on Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction, forecasting, and real-time monitoring. It utilizes machine learning models to predict AQI levels based on historical data, provides future forecasts, and integrates live data monitoring to track air quality in real time.

## Features
- **AQI Prediction:** Machine learning-based predictions using historical air quality data.
- **AQI Forecasting:** Time series forecasting models to estimate future AQI levels.
- **Live Monitoring:** Integration with live AQI data sources for real-time tracking.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive graphs and charts for AQI trends.
- **Deployment:** Web-based dashboard for easy access to predictions and monitoring.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Framework:** Flask/Django (for deployment)
- **Data Sources:** OpenAQ API, Kaggle datasets
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Dash

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aqi-prediction.git
   cd aqi-prediction
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Train the model using historical AQI data.
- Use the forecasting module to predict future AQI trends.
- Monitor real-time AQI levels from live data sources.
- Visualize trends through the web dashboard.

## Dataset
- Historical AQI data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Live data from [OpenAQ API](https://openaq.org/)

## Model Training
1. Preprocess the dataset.
2. Train machine learning models (Random Forest, LSTM, XGBoost).
3. Evaluate model performance.
4. Deploy the best-performing model.

## Deployment
- Web-based dashboard using Flask/Django.
- Hosted on AWS/GCP/Heroku.
